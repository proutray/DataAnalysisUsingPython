Things to Note:
* First Question: I am printing the number of lines in both the files.
* Second Question: Done as per the requirements.
* Third Question: I have included two different plots for Barcelona ( Spain and Venezuela)
* Bonus Question One: 'finalfile.csv' is being generated as per requirements. Had to play around a bit with the column formats.
