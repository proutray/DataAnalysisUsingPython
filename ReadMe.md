Things to Note:
*First Question: I am printing the number of lines in both the files.
*Second Question: Done as per the requirements.
*Third Question: I have included two different plots for Barcelona ( Spain and Venezuela)
*Bonus Question One: 'finalfile.csv' is being generated as per requirements. Had to play around a bit with the column formats.
